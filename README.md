# The-Eye
Project for Insight Global

## Entities
- The entities for this project are flexible enough to store any object as the data is stored as a json object

## Constraints
- This project had fairly simple restraints, I was simply told to make an api that stores events it's given
 
## Requirements
- As long as one can run python3 and django, there are not really any requirements for this api

## Use Cases
- The use case for an api of this sort would be to have all the events of a certain page or app stored and saved for later use

## Routes
This api has 2 routes:
1. /info_api/ - POST: This route is for adding events to the database
2. /query/ - GET: This route is for doing a general query of the database
